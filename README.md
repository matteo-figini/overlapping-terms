# OverlappingTerms
This project is a personal project by Matteo Figini that aims to find possible overlapping exams on a given session during exam scheduling at Politecnico di Milano, specially designed for the Industrial and Information Engineering School. The program is a simple CLI (Command-Line Interface) program, written in Java language, which reads in input a CSV file of exam dates expressed in a specific format, and - chosen a proper level of overlap - returns all the possible overlaps both in a textual file and in the CLI.

## Prerequisites
First of all, to run the program you should have Java 11 installed on your computer. It should work also with later versions. If you have trouble installing Java, you can follow the instructions at the following link: [Java Download Options](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).

Once you have installed Java, download the file "OverlappingTerms.jar", under the /bin directory; afterwards, open the terminal window in the location in which the file "OverlappingTerms.jar" is located, then write and execute the following command:
```
java -jar OverlappingTerms.jar
```

## Input file: a CSV file
As expressed in the program, the input file is a CSV file containing a set of rows, each expressing an exam term for a given course (e.g. Computer Science Eng. BSc, Computer Science Eng. MSc, Biomedical Engineering BSc...). Each row is formatted in the following way:
```
<EXAM_NAMES>;<EXAM_YEAR>;<EXAM_SEMESTER>;<IS_MANDATORY>;<FIRST_CALL_DATE>;<FIRST_CALL_SLOT>(;<EXAM_CALL_DATE>;<EXAM_CALL_SLOT>)*
```
meaning that one can define one or more dates for exam calls and the corresponding slot. Here below a complete explanation of the parts is provided:
- **EXAM_NAMES** corresponds to the name of the exam. In its basic version, the name is nothing but a string that contains the name for the exam; if needed, it is possible to provide some additional information that may be useful for the user. For example, suppose the exam is dispensed to a specific "PSPA - Piano di Studi Preventivamente Approvato" and this information is relevant to understand the level of overlaps. In that case, it is suggested to insert this information between brackets. One possible example derives from the BSc of Mechanical Engineering, in which different exams are provided to different PSPAs:
```
MACCHINE [VA1]
STATISTICS [VA1/E]
PROGETTAZIONE DI SISTEMI MECCANICI [VA2,VA5,VA6]
```
- **EXAM_YEAR** is the year the exam is traditionally dispensed. If the course doesn't have a specific year of reference (e.g. in Master's Degrees this is quite common), it is possible to indicate this as "1". Keep in mind that, if a certain course is dispensed for more than one year, there are two possible solutions:
  -  The first trivial solution is duplicating the corresponding row, changing only the year and keeping all other fields the same.
  -  The second solution is to consider all the courses as of the same year, for example by setting "1" for all the courses.
- **EXAM_SEMESTER** (1 or 2) is the semester in which the course is dispensed.
- **IS_MANDATORY** is a flag that indicates to the user whether the given course is mandatory or not.
- **n_CALL_DATE** represents one date for the given exam in the format __dd/MM/yyyy__;
- **n_CALL_SLOT** represents the slot for the previous date reported. 3 different values may be used to indicate the slot:
  - _F1_ stands for the first-morning slot (typically 08:00 - 11:30);
  - _F2_ stands for the late-morning slot (typically 11:30 - 15:00);
  - _F3_ stands for the afternoon slot (typically 15:00 - 18:30);

One particular exam may require more than one slot: in this case it is suggested to replicate the row as many times as the number of time slots interested, changing only the slot and keeping all other fields the same.

You can find an example of an input CSV file under the main directory, in a file called _"exams_INF_LT.csv"_. __Remember: the CSV file must be located in the same directory of the executable JAR file!__

## Levels of overlap
The program allows one to choose among different levels of overlap. The level of overlap is required via an integer number: the first level corresponds to "1", the second level to "2" and so on.
1. The __first level__ (the strictest one) returns all and only the exams with different names belonging to the same year and the same semester, that are set as "mandatory" and have a distance of two days or less between the first exam term and the second exam term.
2. The __second level__ returns all and only the exams, mandatory or not, with different names, that belong to the same year and the same semester and have a distance in days between the first exam term and the second exam term lower or equal to a value specified by the user.
3. The __third level__ returns all and only the exams, mandatory or not, with different names, regardless of the year and the semester, that are scheduled on the same date and in the same time slot.
4. The __fourth level__ returns all and only the exams, mandatory or not, with different names, regardless of the year and the semester, that are scheduled with a distance in days between the first exam term and the second exam term lower or equal to a value specified by the user.

The user is asked to provide the following information:
- The name of the input CSV file: **must end with ".csv"** to recognize a CSV file;
- The number of exam terms considered: e.g. if you want to check overlaps for the June and July exam calls, meaning that for each row you express two dates and the corresponding time slots, you will insert 2;
- The level of overlap desired: it is an integer number between 1 and 4 (see the previous point);
- If needed, the parameter representing the maximum distance in days considered as "overlap".

### Considerations on the levels of overlap
_WARNING: This paragraph is not strictly necessary for a basic comprehension of the program, but contains some logic and mathematical stuff that better highlights the program execution. You can safely skip this paragraph and go to the next one._

## Output file and considerations
Once the program starts the computation, it searches for a list of overlapping exams based on the parameters passed as input. The outcome of the program is reported both on the console and in a file called "overlaps.txt", in the following format (Italian language):
```
{ <CALL>Â° appello => [FIRST EXAM] & [SECOND_EXAM] }
```
with the following meaning:
- CALL is an integer number between 1 and the number of exam terms inserted, indicating in which exam call the problem arises;
- FIRST_EXAM and SECOND_EXAM contain the information of, respectively, the first and the second overlapping exams, such as the name of the exams, the year, the semester, whether the exam is mandatory or not and finally the dates and the time slots in which the problem arises.
